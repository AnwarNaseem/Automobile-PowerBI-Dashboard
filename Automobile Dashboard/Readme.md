**Process:**

Data Cleaning & Transformation: Processed raw data to remove inconsistencies, handle duplicates, and standardize categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Categorized vehicles by brand, model, and type (hatchback, convertible, etc.) for better insights.

**Workflow in Dashboard:**

Data Processing: Ensured accurate and clean data representation.
Visualization: Developed an interactive dashboard to analyze RPM trends, horsepower distribution, and performance comparisons.
Filters & Controls: Enabled selection based on brand, fuel type, and price range for customized analysis.

**Tools Used:**

Power BI – For data visualization & dashboard design
DAX – For data calculations & transformations

**Outcome:**

The dashboard provides an interactive and insightful view of vehicle performance across brands, helping automobile enthusiasts, analysts, and industry experts make data-driven decisions. It allows real-time filtering and comparative analysis for deeper insights.
